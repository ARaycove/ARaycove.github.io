            <h2>I am From</h2>
            <p>I am from Legos and computer screens</p>
            <p>I am from trailer parks, noisy train tracks, and stolen bicycles.</p>
            <p>I am from weeds in the curbs and sidewalks, and colorful tulips in mulched beds.</p>
            <p>not from lengthy family traditions, but from hard work and dedication.
                from a vying for a better life.</p>
            <p>From a good dad, and a loving grandmother.</p>
            <p>I'm from struggle and hardship.</p>
            <p>From lots of encouragement, everything from "you're so smart" to "you'll go far" and "I believe in you". Though I never really believed any of it.</p>
            <p>I'm from broken homes. I've learned why I don't remember much of my early childhood, but despite that, My father never stopped from trying his best.</p>
            <p>I'm from Canada, and Chicago too. Though I'm told we came from Europe many generations ago.</p>
            <p>I'm from Mac & Cheese, with hotdogs. . .</p>
            <p>From fear and adventure.</p>
            <p>From love and heartbreak turned bad-blood, two families "under a truce".</p>
            <p>My father started by looking for a better life, and ended up spending it doing his best to make ours better instead. Sacrificing his own ambition in the process.</p>
            <p>I think of tragedy, and redemption.</p>
            <p>No matter how hard it got they've kept going.</p>
            <p>The lives they lived were imperfect, and those who came before made great mistakes and endured much. but that leads us to today, and the story goes on.</p>
            <p>I have no mementos or family pictures, no archives to peruse.</p>
            <p>Only the memories I carry with me, and I can truly say I'm proud of where I've come from.</p>
            <p>and I hope one day my children will be able to say the same.</p>
