            <h2>I am From</h2>
            <p>I am from Legos and computer screens</p>
            <p>I am from trailer parks, noisy train tracks, and stolen bicycles.</p>
            <p>I am from weeds in the curbs and sidewalks, and colorful tulips in mulched beds.</p>
            <p>not from lengthy family traditions, but from hard work and dedication.
                from a vying for a better life.</p>
            <p>From a good dad, and a loving grandmother.</p>
            <p>I'm from struggle and hardship.</p>
            <p>From lots of encouragement, everything from "you're so smart" to "you'll go far" and "I believe in you". Though I never really believed any of it.</p>
            <p>I'm from broken homes. I've learned why I don't remember much of my early childhood, but despite that, My father never stopped from trying his best.</p>
            <p>I'm from Canada, and Chicago too. Though I'm told we came from Europe many generations ago.</p>
            <p>I'm from Mac & Cheese, with hotdogs. . .</p>
            <p>From fear and adventure.</p>
            <p>From love and heartbreak turned bad-blood, two families "under a truce".</p>
            <p>My father started by looking for a better life, and ended up spending it doing his best to make ours better instead. Sacrificing his own ambition in the process.</p>
            <p>I think of tragedy, and redemption.</p>
            <p>No matter how hard it got they've kept going.</p>
            <p>The lives they lived were imperfect, and those who came before made great mistakes and endured much. but that leads us to today, and the story goes on.</p>
            <p>I have no mementos or family pictures, no archives to peruse.</p>
            <p>Only the memories I carry with me, and I can truly say I'm proud of where I've come from.</p>
            <p>and I hope one day my children will be able to say the same.</p>

            <h2>The Worst Day of Your Life</h2>
            <p>You enter the world under a ring of bright lights, covered in goop, you have to clear your throat. You let out a cry, you can't see, and then you feel a warm embrace.</p>
            <p>It's the best, and worst day of your life.</p>
            <p>The year passes, and you take your first step. You fall squarely on your bum, a jolt of pain passes and you cry for a long time.</p>
            <p>and its the worst day of your life.</p>
            <p>You learn to walk and soon to eat, your favorite chocolate milk in hand and curled in your favorite blanket. You misjudge and now a brown stain appears, the milk is gone.</p>
            <p>and its the worst day your life.</p>
            <p>You learn to run, and soon you fall. A bloody spot on the pavement, and the skin missing from your knee, your father tends to you and it hurts so very much. </p>
            <p>It's the worst day of your life</p>
            <p>You go to school, and make great friends. Then you have a fight and you aren't friends anymore. You cry, you go home and curl up in your father's arms.</p>
            <p>It's the worst day of your life</p>
            <p>The years pass, and your first real exams come about. You're confident you think, but you get it back and a failing grade is all you see.</p>
            <p>It's the worst day of your life</p>
            <p>But school soon ends, a diploma in hand, and a pretty girl around your waist. You wrecked your first car on your way home to see her,</p>
            <p>and it's the worst day of your life</p>
            <p>Before you know it, kids play happily in the lawn and many great years are behind you, but she says she's not happy anymore and soon she's no more,</p>
            <p>and it's the worst day of your life</p>
            <p>Now in the middle of your workday, you get a call, it's from the daycare. Your son is on the way to the hospital, they're trying to revive him. But the effort is in vain. You lay your son in a body bag, kiss his forehead one last time, </p>
            <p>and it's the worst day of your life</p>
            <p>But life goes on, and now you have another baby, she's three. You sit her down for dinner, wrap her in her favorite blanket and give her a glass of chocolate milk, the biggest grin you'll ever see. But she slips and a brown stain appears, her chocolate milk is gone. So you comfort her because</p>
            <p>It's the worst day of her life.</p>

            <h2>Academic Plan</h2>
            <div class="academic_plan_grid">
                <div class="narrative">
                    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                    <p>I am a non-traditional student coming back to school after almost a decade in order to change career paths. 
                        I've been driving a truck for the last 5 years and because of it my social and mental well being has 
                        suffered greatly. However during this time I rediscovered the joy of learning through audiobooks, as a 
                        result I was able to explore other possibilities through the great world of books. They're a window into 
                        a wider world for those who can't experience it themselves. So I learned about the wider world and 
                        how I fit into it, I explored the meaning of life and subsequently explored the pointlessness of it all. 
                        Yet through that experience I regained what I once had as a child, a great curiosity about everything under the sun and beyond it, 
                        and most importantly an idealism that the world doesn't have to be what it is. It can be better and we can do something about it. 
                        We're not destined to continue old patterns.</p>
                    <h3>Doing something about it:</h3>
                    <p>It's not enough for me to just think about it, I need to do something
                         about it. From the driver's seat of truck, there's not much you 
                         can do. I've tried a lot of things and failed, but that's OK. 
                         So this time I'm choosing to get a more formal education and 
                         perhaps find people I can connect with. My primary goal here is to
                          learn and find a network of people that I can work with to mold a
                           brighter future with. And most importantly help others along the
                            way in whatever capacity I can.</p>
                    <p>I believe strongly that I will eventually find a position in the public
                         sector serving in an academic settings. Much of civic policy is 
                         determined by the research of academics, so it serves as a way to 
                         make real change.</p>
                    <h3>Networking</h3>
                    <p>During my time at university I hope to develop my communication 
                        skills, and network with as many people as I can. While this is 
                        out of my comfort zone, I believe it to be essential to my plans. </p>
                    <p>To further this part of my plan, I am vying for the president 
                        position of the computer science club. This would allow me to 
                        network with faculty and work with them to provide opportunities 
                        to my fellow CS majors. In addition to operating a club. I will 
                        also be seeking relevant internships to further develop my skills 
                        and network.</p>
                    <h3>Specializing:</h3>
                    <p>Ideals only get you so far, so I'm choosing to specialize in the area
                         of Computer Science as I believe it to be the most powerful and 
                         versatile skill-set to achieve my more "grander" visions. It's my 
                         belief that becoming especially skilled in this field will allow me
                          to interface with experts in every field. However I do understand 
                          I have much to learn, after initial assessments it seems I've 
                          forgotten a great deal of things from High School, most notably 
                          I need to learn a great deal of mathematics and I'm starting over 
                          at basic algebra. So while this is a great hurdle, I plan to take 
                          summer classes and employ my newfound ability to self-study topics
                           to "catch up" so I have time to take the higher level mathematics
                            courses that will aid in my mastery of my chosen field.</p>
                    <h3>Personal Development:</h3>
                    <p>The major I have chosen is rather rigid in the course requirements, so
                         a large bulk of the classes selected are directly related and it 
                         leaves very little room for other interests. Given I have rather 
                         grand ambitions, there are a great deal of skills and knowledge I 
                         must learn as well. Ranking at the top of this list is an 
                         understanding of Public speaking, Leadership, Writing, Psychology, 
                         Sociology, Anthropology, and History. These don't fit in my major, 
                         and there is only limited space to fit some of this into my first 
                         four years. I have already been reading a great deal in my spare 
                         time on these topics, and I look forward to the opportunity to audit
                          some of these classes. Despite the fact that I would not get credit
                           for auditing classes in these fields I will still get to learn and
                            gain expertise across the a wider spectrum. This will assist me
                             in being able to achieve more in life.</p>
