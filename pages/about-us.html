            <h2>I am From</h2>
            <p>I am from Legos and computer screens</p>
            <p>I am from trailer parks, noisy train tracks, and stolen bicycles.</p>
            <p>I am from weeds in the curbs and sidewalks, and colorful tulips in mulched beds.</p>
            <p>not from lengthy family traditions, but from hard work and dedication.
                from a vying for a better life.</p>
            <p>From a good dad, and a loving grandmother.</p>
            <p>I'm from struggle and hardship.</p>
            <p>From lots of encouragement, everything from "you're so smart" to "you'll go far" and "I believe in you". Though I never really believed any of it.</p>
            <p>I'm from broken homes. I've learned why I don't remember much of my early childhood, but despite that, My father never stopped from trying his best.</p>
            <p>I'm from Canada, and Chicago too. Though I'm told we came from Europe many generations ago.</p>
            <p>I'm from Mac & Cheese, with hotdogs. . .</p>
            <p>From fear and adventure.</p>
            <p>From love and heartbreak turned bad-blood, two families "under a truce".</p>
            <p>My father started by looking for a better life, and ended up spending it doing his best to make ours better instead. Sacrificing his own ambition in the process.</p>
            <p>I think of tragedy, and redemption.</p>
            <p>No matter how hard it got they've kept going.</p>
            <p>The lives they lived were imperfect, and those who came before made great mistakes and endured much. but that leads us to today, and the story goes on.</p>
            <p>I have no mementos or family pictures, no archives to peruse.</p>
            <p>Only the memories I carry with me, and I can truly say I'm proud of where I've come from.</p>
            <p>and I hope one day my children will be able to say the same.</p>

            <h2>The Worst Day of Your Life</h2>
            <p>You enter the world under a ring of bright lights, covered in goop, you have to clear your throat. You let out a cry, you can't see, and then you feel a warm embrace.</p>
            <p>It's the best, and worst day of your life.</p>
            <p>The year passes, and you take your first step. You fall squarely on your bum, a jolt of pain passes and you cry for a long time.</p>
            <p>and its the worst day of your life.</p>
            <p>You learn to walk and soon to eat, your favorite chocolate milk in hand and curled in your favorite blanket. You misjudge and now a brown stain appears, the milk is gone.</p>
            <p>and its the worst day your life.</p>
            <p>You learn to run, and soon you fall. A bloody spot on the pavement, and the skin missing from your knee, your father tends to you and it hurts so very much. </p>
            <p>It's the worst day of your life</p>
            <p>You go to school, and make great friends. Then you have a fight and you aren't friends anymore. You cry, you go home and curl up in your father's arms.</p>
            <p>It's the worst day of your life</p>
            <p>The years pass, and your first real exams come about. You're confident you think, but you get it back and a failing grade is all you see.</p>
            <p>It's the worst day of your life</p>
            <p>But school soon ends, a diploma in hand, and a pretty girl around your waist. You wrecked your first car on your way home to see her,</p>
            <p>and it's the worst day of your life</p>
            <p>Before you know it, kids play happily in the lawn and many great years are behind you, but she says she's not happy anymore and soon she's no more,</p>
            <p>and it's the worst day of your life</p>
            <p>Now in the middle of your workday, you get a call, it's from the daycare. Your son is on the way to the hospital, they're trying to revive him. But the effort is in vain. You lay your son in a body bag, kiss his forehead one last time, </p>
            <p>and it's the worst day of your life</p>
            <p>But life goes on, and now you have another baby, she's three. You sit her down for dinner, wrap her in her favorite blanket and give her a glass of chocolate milk, the biggest grin you'll ever see. But she slips and a brown stain appears, her chocolate milk is gone. So you comfort her because</p>
            <p>It's the worst day of her life.</p>
